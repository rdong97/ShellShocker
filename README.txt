ShellShocker is a side-scrolling, action/adventure, 8-bit, role-playing game (RPG) contracted by BitBlit Interactive (BBI), a digital entertainment media 
publisher based in Austin, TX. In the ShellShocker game, the user controls an attack vehicle named the Ragnar. The Ragnar has boarded onto an alien ship
threatening to destroy the user's home planet of Azaran. The mission of the Ragnar is to cripple the alien ship by destroying the main reactors.

in order reach the target destination, where he or she will destroy the reactors, winning the game.

Created on the following software:
    Java (Platform SE 7)
    NetBeans (Version 7.3.1)

a hard drive or flash USB. The game will not run from a CD-R.
The following should be visible:
-The ShellShocker project folder; inside are folders for:
--build: Information created by Netbeans during the project build.
--dist: All important files that are generated here, including javadocs and the Java Archive (JAR) file have been moved outside to the project folder.
--nbproject: Contains all Netbeans matadata on the ShellShocker project. This directory is machine specific, not project specific.
--src: All source code files for the ShellShocker game will be located in this folder.
--datafiles: All files for database storage are found here.
--musicFiles: All audio files are found in this folder.
--resources: All graphics and images used in the ShellShocker game will be located in this folder.'
--Java Archive file (JAR) named ShellShocker. It is crucial that the 3 aforementioned folders are placed in the dist folder
  with the JAR file. If the three folders aforementioned are missing, no images, sound, nor characters can be created.

Game Instructions:
-----------------------

To run the game:
	First, open the ShellShocker project folder. Then open the "dist" folder that contains the Java Archive (JAR) file. 
	Open (double click) the ShellShocker.jar file. This launches the menu of the ShellShocer game. If a blank window opens
	along with an error message window, this means that the game was unable to properly function. Refer to the above instructions
	on correct placement of certain files that permit the game to run.

At the menu, 5 option buttons are available: Press "Existing User Login" to access a previously created account. Press "Create New Profile" to 
start a new personal profile. Press "Tutorial" to learn in-game controls and the storyline. Press "Credits" to find out the creators of the Shellshocker game.
Press "Exit" to close the game. To return to the menu, simply press the "back" arrows to return to  previously visited page.


In the "Login" screen:
    "Enter username:" -- this is the name of your username
    "Enter password" -- this is the password linked to your username
    "Login" -- this button checks the username and password and allows the user to start the game
In the "Create New" screen:
    "Enter username:" -- this is the name of your username
    "Enter password" -- this is the password linked to your username
    "Create" -- this button creates a new profile and to start the game

To start movement of the character, click once in the window. This step is necessary in order to insure that the 
user has the proper materials needed to play the game.

Control Keys: (used to play the game)
    W -- Move up
    A -- Move left
    S -- Move down
    D -- Move right
    Space -- Hover
    P -- Pulls up a Pause Menu
    F -- Change primary Weapon to a flamethrower and vice versa.
    E -- Change secondary weapon to a mine layer and vice versa.
    Right Click -- Fires the secondary weapon.
    Left Click -- Fires the primary weapon. 

To pause the game, press "P", this brings up a screen that allows the user to save their progress, take a rest, or to simply exit the game.

During the game, if the main player "dies" from damage dealt by enemy characters, a screen will pull up that allows users to 
restart the game from a last known checkpoint or to simply exit. 

To win the game, proceed through the map by opening doors that allow access to checkpoints and new levels. The final level is won by 
defeating the "boss" enemies in order to destroy the crucial reactors that power the ship destroying the planet Azaran.

Development Information
------------------------

Development diagrams can be found also in the dist folder. Raw diagrams include the Universal Modeling Language (UML) diagram and other diagrams
such as data flow and Software development methology can be found in the project plan document.

Warning, if project is recompiled and built, it will generate into the "dist" folder. Move the JAR file out into the project folder in order to access
images, and music.
